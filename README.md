# Tetris but with Python
This is a Tetris-like game, made in Python using the Pygame library. Have fun playing this game in school, at work, or anywhere else where you shouldn't game! (Please don't actually do that :3)
# How to use
To play the game, you need to install Python and and then use
```
pip install pygame
```
to install Pygame. After that simply download this repository, and go into the Tetris folder, and then you want to find the Python file called tetris.py and double click. A command line window will appear, and that's fine, don't panic. It's just Python that's opening, and I'm not hacking you (I don't know how I'd do that). Just wait a little bit and a Window will open with the heading "Tetris". Now you can play. Yippie! 
# Things I need/want to add

# How you can help me
If anyone adds anything, I'd be very happy if you'd share it with me, so that I can make it available/make you a contributer (I think that's how it works? I'm new to GitHub) and credit you in the README.md. Also, there is no license, so you can take it and re-publich it and stuff, I don't mind. Have fun with it.
You can send me changes to publish under m.shafiei@europagym.at, and I'll make sure to send over a Thank you. If you do send me something, I'd love to know your GitHub user name, if you have one, or any name that I can put in the **Credits** section below.
