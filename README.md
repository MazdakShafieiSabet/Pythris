# Tetris but with Python
This is a Tetris-like game, made in Python using the Pygame library. Have fun playing this game in school, at work, or anywhere else where you shouldn't game! (Please don't actually do that :3)
# How to use
-------------------------
To play the game, you need to install Python and and then use
```
pip install pygame
```
to install Pygame. After that simply download this repository, and go into the Tetris folder, and then you want to find the Python file called tetris.py and double click. A command line window will appear, and that's fine, don't panic. It's just Python that's opening, and I'm not hacking you (I don't know how I'd do that). Just wait a little bit and a Window will open with the heading "Tetris". Now you can play. Yippie! 
# Things I need/want to add
-------------------------
* Music
* Sounds
* Better UI handling
* The "Black Screen of Death"
* Randomized colours after a certain level
